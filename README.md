# RedditForBlindChromeExtension
Open-source Chrome extension that will allow to open reddit links in the RedditForBlind app.

## How to use
1. In the RedditForBlind app, go to settings, and find the setting to allow links to be opened in the app, turn the setting on.
1. Install this Chrome extension from the Chrome Store
1. Try it by going to reddit.com/r/blind, you will see a "Open subreddit in RFB" link at the top of the page, activate it and it should open in the app. You will notice multiple links like that on the page, for instance next to posts in the post feed.


Optional: the chrome extension has a setting to replace links instead of showing "Open in RFB" links to the side. Open the "Open in RFB" chrome extension settings page. This mode is not recommended at this time, but feel free to try it.
